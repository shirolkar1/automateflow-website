## Customization

You can easily customize this clone by:

1. **Colors**: Modify CSS custom properties in `main.css`
2. **Content**: Update text content in `index.html`
3. **Images**: Replace images in the `assets/images/` directory
4. **Functionality**: Extend JavaScript in `main.js`

## Formspree Integration

Forms across the site can now send real submissions through [Formspree](https://formspree.io/). To hook them up:

1. Create a Formspree form for each workflow you want to capture (Contact Sales, General Contact, Product Demo, Live Demo) and copy its endpoint URL (e.g., `https://formspree.io/f/abc12345`).
2. Open `assets/js/main.js` and set the values in the `defaultFormspreeConfig` object near the top of the file to those endpoint URLs. The repo currently points all flows to `https://formspree.io/f/xjkpblpj`; tweak as needed. You can also inject `window.formspreeConfig` before loading `main.js` if you prefer to keep the values separate from source control.
3. Each HTML form already includes a `data-formspree-key` that maps to the config:
   - `contact.html` â†’ `contactSales`
   - `contact-us.html` â†’ `contactGeneral`
   - `demo.html` â†’ `productDemo`
   - `request-live-demo.html` â†’ `liveDemo`
   To override a single form, add `data-formspree-endpoint="https://formspree.io/f/yourFormId"` directly on the `<form>` tag.
4. Deploy the site and submit a test entry from the live URL. A success notification in the UI and a matching entry in the Formspree dashboard confirms the integration is working.

If a form key does not have an endpoint configured, it automatically falls back to demo mode (the form validates and resets without sending data off the page).

- This is a static clone and does not include backend functionality
- Forms are pre-wired to Formspree (currently `https://formspree.io/f/xjkpblpj`)â€”update the config if you need different endpoints
- Some images are placeholders and would need to be replaced with actual assets
- Links point to placeholder URLs
